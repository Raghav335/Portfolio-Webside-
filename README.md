# Portfolio Website — Raghav Gupta

A clean, responsive portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (no build tools).  
Perfect to publish on GitHub Pages or use as a starting point for your portfolio.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles (dark theme by default)
- `script.js` — interactions (menu, theme toggle, smooth scroll)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `portfolio`).
2. Add these files to the repo root.
3. Edit `index.html`:
   - Replace name/title/contact links (email, GitHub, LinkedIn).
   - Update Projects section with your projects and correct links.
   - Optionally set your Formspree form `action` or wire the form to your backend.
4. Commit and push.
5. (Optional) Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (choose `main` branch, `/ (root)`).

## Customization tips
- Replace placeholder avatar with your photo (inside `.hero-card .profile-photo` or as an `<img>`).
- Add more projects — copy the `.project-card` markup.
- Consider adding analytics, more pages, or a blog later.

## License
You can reuse and modify this template for personal and commercial projects. Attribution is appreciated but not required.

If you want, I can:
- Replace placeholders with your actual name, email and social links.
- Add more project cards using your GitHub repo links.
- Prepare the repo structure and a `.gitignore` or a deploy-ready branch for GitHub Pages.
